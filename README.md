# **Hotel Management Project**

#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ it's arixstoo again !
## Project Description
The project was developed in collaboration with a team (the collaborators of this repository). The project is a hotel management system, developed in Java with a user interface using Swing and a database using MongoDB. The application allows users to make room reservations, display details of available rooms, and manage existing reservations. The application also provides a complete interface and control for the hotel admins and receptionists.

## Technologies Used
**- Programming Language** : **Java**

**- GUI Library** : **Swing**

**- Database Management** : **MongoDB** (via the Java MongoDB driver)

**- Collections and Maps** : Before integrating MongoDB, the data was stored using **Maps** in Java to organize and manipulate information.

**- MVC (Model-View-Controller)** : Architecture used to **organize** the application's code in a **modular** and maintainable way.

## Project Structure: MVC Architecture (Model-View-Controller)
The **MVC** architecture divides the application into three main components:

### **Model**:
Represents the **data** of the application. In this project, it includes classes like `Chambre`, **Client**, and `RÃ©servation` that interact with **MongoDB** to manage data. These classes centralize the manipulation and validation of data.

### **View**:
Handles the **user interface** of the application. It consists of Swing windows and panels, such as in the `reservation` class, allowing users to **select** rooms and **enter** dates.

### **Controller**:
Coordinates the **interactions** between the model and the view. It captures user actions **(button clicks)** and updates the model accordingly. For example, in the `reservation` class, the **"continuer"** button triggers model updates and displays error messages if necessary.

## Key Features
**Make Reservations**: Allows online reservations by **selecting** available rooms and providing check-in and check-out **dates**.

**Room Modification**: Available rooms are displayed with **their characteristics**, such as type and price. Users can select desired rooms for **their reservation**.

**Date Validation**: The system checks that the entered dates are in the **correct** format and that they are **valid** to avoid input errors.

## Administrative Features
The admin side of the application offers additional functionalities for managing reservations and rooms:

**View Reservations**: Administrators can access an interface displaying all **reservations** made, with options to **accept or deny** bookings. Reservations are listed with **relevant details** such as client name, stay dates, and reserved rooms.

**Room Management**: Administrators can see all **available** rooms and their status (free or occupied). They have the option to update room information, such as **price** and type.

**Hotel Management**: Administrators can **modify** details of existing reservations, including adding or **removing** rooms, as well as changing **stay dates**.

## Instructions for Running
### Clone the Repository:
Write in the bash: `git clone https://github.com/arixstoo/Hotel-Management-Project.git`

### Configure the Project:
Ensure Java is installed on your machine.  
Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.

### Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies for MongoDB (add them to the `pom.xml` file if you're using Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle).

### Run the Application:
Execute the class `/Controller/main` to start the application.
